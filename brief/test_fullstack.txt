Goal:
  The goal is to create a full application using restful API.

Context:
  We want to create an application for music lessons. A lesson can or cannot be teached at different level.
You have to be logged in to consult a lesson (do not manage the connection / user part, just assume they are managed somewhere)

Back:
 Create the following APIâ€™s:
   - The 6 most used lessons in each level
   - List all the lessons available for a given level
   - Get detail of a lesson for a given id + level
   - Create a lesson (title only do not manage image upload, you will integrate them directly in your application.)

Front:
 Create one angular application :
	- integrate the psd in responsive
	- show lessons thanks to the API. Must match the PSD provided.

Send a link github with a readme to explain how launch the application


Bonus:
  Front: Use sass
  Back: Create a security on your API


We expect to see quality code, well decoupled and to understand how you think. Surprise us!
